# Sampling Cycle

```text
sampling deadline

platform batch collection
   ↓
typed snapshot

delta / aggregation / bounded history
   ↓
UI state update
```

A sampling cycle performs one coordinated batch rather than independent polling per widget or metric. Transiently unavailable native data is represented as unavailable data, not as a reason to rebuild the pipeline.
